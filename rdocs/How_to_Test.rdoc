= How to Test

Here is the following code for Rake testing

	% Rakefile

	task :default => [:test, :PlayRockPaperScissorsGame, :rps]

	file_path = "./test/test_rps.rb"

	task :test do 
		ruby file_path
	end

	task :PlayRockPaperScissorsGame do
		ruby file_path
	end

	task :rps do
		ruby file_path
	end

Meaning that you could techincally do `rake test`, `rake PlayRockPaperScissorsGame`, or `rake rps` to test.
