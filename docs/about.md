# About PlayRockPaperScissorsGame (RPS)

The RPS<sup>1</sup> game has been around for many years. In fact, it originally was from Asia. 
I have decided to code a Ruby-programmed RPS game that uses full CLI<sup>2</sup> (command line interface).

## Why use Ruby?

Ruby is a programming language that has been around for a little over 2 decades. The gem-attributed language was primarily developed by *Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto* in Japan. Ruby stood out to me because of it's unique code structure design. I decided to use Ruby becuase I wanted to learn an **object oriented programming language**.

> **1.** RPS = rock-paper-scissors
> 
> **2.** CLI means that it is executed in a command line app, such as CMD (command prompt) for Windows, or Terminal for Mac.
