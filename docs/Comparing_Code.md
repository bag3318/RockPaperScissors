## Beginner's Code

### Beginner's code Pros
+ Simple
- Easy to understand
* Short

### Beginner's code Cons
+ Unorganized
- Lacks modularization
* Many `if`s and `else`s

### What Beginner's Code Looks :ike

__`% ruby beginner.rb`__

```ruby
options = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
computer_choice = options[rand(options.length)] 
 # the above line chooses a random pick in the options array, and the `options.length` means to choose from however many options there are in the `options` array
puts "What's your choice?"
puts "rock, paper, or scissors"
user_input = gets.chomp.downcase # `gets.chomp` reads user input, .downcase is like `.toLowerCase()` in javascript
loop do 
  if (user_input == "rock" || user_input == "paper" || user_input == "scissors")
    if (user_input == computer_choice)
      puts "We got the same, let's keep playing!"
    elsif (user_input == "rock" && computer_choice == "scissors")
      puts "computer choice is: " + computer_choice + " , you win! :)"
    elsif (user_input == "rock" && computer_choice == "paper")
      puts "computer choice is: " + computer_choice + " ,computer wins :("
    elsif (user_input == "paper" && computer_choice == "scissors")
      puts "computer choice is: " + computer_choice + " ,computer wins :("
    elsif (user_input == "paper" && computer_choice == "rock")
      puts "computer choice is: " + computer_choice + " , you win! :)"
    elsif (user_input == "scissors" && computer_choice == "rock")
      puts "computer choice is: " + computer_choice + " ,computer wins :("
    elsif (user_input == "scissors" && computer_choice == "paper")
      puts "computer choice is: " + computer_choice + " , you win! :)"
    end
    else 
    puts "Invalid choice, enter Rock, Paper, or Scissors"
    puts "What's your choice?"
    user_input = gets.chomp.downcase # have the user choose again
  end
  break # break the loop after all the above has been completed
end
```

## Advanced Code

### Advanced Code Pros

+ Organized
- Modularized
* Structured

### Advanced Code Cons

+ Long
- Hard to understand

### What Advanced Code Looks Like
